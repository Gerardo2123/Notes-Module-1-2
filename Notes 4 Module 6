•	Cybersecurity is one of the ways used to protect your security online.
•	The risks are:
1.	Hackers, attackers, intruders
2.	Malicious Code or Malware
3.	Vulnerabilities
•	The ways to minimize risk are:
1.	Keeping software up to date
2.	Running UpToDate antivirus software
3.	Strong passwords
4.	Multi-factor authentication
5.	Firewalls
6.	Be suspicious of things like emails.
•	AWS has its security responsibilities but so does the customer.
•	IAM is Identity and Access Management and it’s a web service that helps you control access to AWS resources for your users securely.
•	Allows to give authorization to users and permissions to use what you allow them to
•	Some features of IAM:
1.	Shared Access to AWS account
2.	MFA (Multi-factor authentication)
3.	Identity information for assurance
4.	PCI DSS Compliance
•	Function and roles of IAM components
1.	IAM user
2.	IAM group
3.	IAM Policy
4.	IAM role
•	Four ways to user IAM: AWS management console, AWS Command Line Tools, AWS SDKs, IAM HTTPS API
•	Tools cloud providers have to secure accounts are AWS organizations, AWS key management Service (KMS), Amazon Cognito and AWS Shield
•	Five principles are for securing Devops:
1.	Automate Security In
2.	Build security champions.
3.	Integrate to fail quickly.
4.	Keep Operational Visibility
5.	No false alarms
•	In a DevOps environment, security isn’t responsible for making sure an application is secure – everyone is.” I like how in the Devops teams everyone is working together and figuring out the issues together, I think it helps the application or what they are working on run better.
•	“It does this by bringing the teams together to share responsibility for software delivery and operation. This organizational alignment supports all the other activities of DevOps.” It is how I mentioned before, working in a team is more beneficial and to me more important.
