•	Scalability is the essence of cloud computing.
•	It is scalable, you pay for what you use and want.
•	Increased security risks in cloud computing
•	Advantage of cloud computing, no need to guess capacities and users go global in minutes.
•	SAAS: Software as a service
•	PAAS: Platform as a service
•	IAAS: Infrastructure as a service
•	IT resources have corresponding symbols.
•	There is vertical and horizontal scaling, vertical is more expensive and uses specialized servers and setup is normally needed but no additional IT resources are needed.
•	Horizontal scaling is instantly available and not limited by hardware capacity.
•	6 properties of cloud computing
1.	User-centric
2.	Task-centric
3.	Powerful
4.	Accessible
5.	Intelligent
6.	Programmable
•	user-centric means once a user is connected to the cloud, whatever is on the cloud is there and will become the users and you can also share with others along with others being able to access the data.
•	task-centric means your focus moves to what you need done and how that application can do it for you such as word processing, excel and email are now becoming less important than the documents they make.
•	IAAS: service and storage, networking firewalls/security, and data center physical plant/building
•	PAAS: Operating systems and Development tool, database management, business analytics and includes IAAS infrastructure.
•	SAAS: Hosted applications/apps and PAAS and IAAS
•	IAAS is sometimes called HAAS meaning hardware as a service.
•	Cloud Deployment Models are private, public, hybrid and community.
•	Private is your own virtualized local data center.
•	Public is available to everyone over the internet.
•	Hybrid is a mix of private and public.
•	Community is several organizations share the same resources.
•	“IT can provide the edge a company needs to outsmart, outpace and out-deliver competitors” says Edward Kiledjian. I found this quote interesting because IT is basically the future from what it seems like now, soon they will AI that will be outsmarting people or things and possibly training or assisting us how to do things.
•	“As of now, computer networks are still in their infancy, but as they grow up and become sophisticated, we will probably see the spread of 'computer utilities' ...” by Leonard Kleinrock. This was back in 1969 and it is true, computer networks and IT has advanced so much and the thing is it is going to keep advancing in many ways, it doesn’t seem like it will be stopping anytime soon as there is so much to be created and figured out
