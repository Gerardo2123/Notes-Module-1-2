•	Devops is a framework that lets people and teams work together in effective ways.
•	Cultural and interpersonal aspects are the big picture.
•	Tools and culture are equally as important and it’s just not another software development methodology, it is important but just a part.
•	The new way of DevOps culture is different than the old way. 
•	Some examples (Facebook); developers work independently doing small changes and bug fox and internal code are released twice a day.
•	Gatekeeper is a tool used to control feature releases, some features are released to all and others to specific users.
•	Old way was teams often worked in a silo with little collab and no responsibility, so operations worked and cleaned up developments code.
•	Like AWS, DevOps is a shared responsibility culture, all can develop, test, deploy and monitor changes.
•	Old way basically took lots of time on many things like multi-hour deployment process for operations and deployed 2-3/ week.
•	New way allows things to be deployed faster and can be deployed in 10 minutes.
•	DevOps means developers and operations to some, and others means a person who goes between the teams.
•	Four pillars of DevOps are collaboration, Affinity, Tools, and Scaling
•	AWS helps you move faster, reduce IT costs, and attain global scale and it offers on demand and pay as you go.
•	Three fundamental drivers of cost which are compute, storage, and outbound data transfer. 
•	IT infrastructure components are hardware, software and networking and the types are traditional infrastructure and cloud.
•	TCO is total cost of ownership and is calculated by many ways some being installation, training, maintenance, hardware, and software acquisition and much more.
•	AWS has a pricing calculator that lets you explore and create an estimate for the cost.
•	AWS organizations let you consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and manage all.
•	Reading 4.13 has a quote that says, “By leveraging the security best practices of AWS, we’ve been able to eliminate a lot of compliance tasks that in the past took up valuable time and money.” 
•	This quote stood out to me as the world evolves and changes being able to make things be faster, and cost less is a huge help for many people that want to start something and can with manage as well as grow it as they want or need.
•	In the video 4.9, Doris says “It is really rewarding helping people to solve their IT problems. My customers are the people that work around me, but I am contributing to the final customer satisfaction too.” I like that she says that because when I also help people with IT issues or even figure something out for myself it makes me feel good and like I was able to do something that is not as easy for others and some people who appreciate it look at you in a “smart way.”
